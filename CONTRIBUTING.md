## Git flow
We use git flow to organize our branches. See more about git flow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

## Main branches
* `stable` - The main branch. It's the branch that will be deployed to production
* `develop` - The branch that will be deployed to staging

## Commit messages
We suggest that commit messages follow the *conventional commit*.

See about *conventional commit* [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# When you're done, make your Pull Request!
  * Commit your changes
  * Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin my-branch`
  * Go to Pull Requests from the root repository and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rustbase/rustbase/pulls) with your commit(s)
